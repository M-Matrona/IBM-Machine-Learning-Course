Streamlit was used to construct a web application detailing my work for the capstone project.  

Unfortunately, the streamlit server is sensitive to the directory structory; meaning the app was not able to build if the files were left in this directory.

A new GitHub project was started to house the files in the proper directory structure.

If you are simply interested in using the final product, follow this link instead:

Note that Streamlit applications go stale if there is not enough traffic.  You may have to wait for the server to compile the final product. This shouldn't take longer than a few minutes.
